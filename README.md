## Dataset Preparation

<details open>

### Remote Sensing Image Classification Dataset

We provide the method of preparing the remote sensing image classification dataset used in the paper.

#### UC Merced Dataset

- Image and annotation download link: [UC Merced Dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html).


#### AID Dataset

- Image and annotation download link: [AID Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiayuanchengala/aid-scene-classification-datasets)„ÄÇ


#### NWPU RESISC45 Dataset

- Image and annotation download link: [NWPU RESISC45 Dataset](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/220767)„ÄÇ


**Note**: The `data` folder of this project provides a small number of image annotation examples for the above datasets.

#### Organization Method

You can also choose other sources to download the data, but you need to organize the dataset in the following formatÔºö

```
${DATASET_ROOT} # Dataset root directory, for example: /home/username/data/UC
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ airplane
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ airplane01.tif
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ airplane02.tif
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
Note: In the project folder `datainfo`, we provide the data set partition file. You can also use the [Python script](tools/rsmamba/split_trainval.py) to divide the data set.

### Other Datasets

If you want to use other datasets, you can refer to the [MMPretrain documentation](https://mmpretrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/dataset_prepare.html) for dataset preparation.

## Model Training

### RSMamba Model

#### Config File and Main Parameter Parsing

We provide the configuration files of RSMamba models with different parameter sizes in the paper, which can be found in the [configuration files](configs/rsmamba) folder. The Config file is fully consistent with the API interface and usage of MMPretrain. Below we provide an analysis of some of the main parameters. If you want to know more about the parameters, you can refer to the [MMPretrain documentation](https://mmpretrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/config.html).

<details>

**Parameter Parsing**Ôºö

- `work_dir`ÔºöThe output path of the model training, generally no need to modify.
- `code_root`ÔºöThe root directory of the code, **modify to the absolute path of the root directory of this project**.
- `data_root`ÔºöThe root directory of the dataset, **modify to the absolute path of the dataset root directory**.
- `batch_size`ÔºöThe batch size of a single card, **needs to be modified according to the memory size**.
- `max_epochs`ÔºöThe maximum number of training epochs, generally no need to modify.
- `vis_backends/WandbVisBackend`ÔºöConfiguration of the network-side visualization tool, **after opening the comment, you need to register an account on the `wandb` official website, and you can view the visualization results during the training process in the web browser**.
- `model/backbone/arch`ÔºöThe type of the model's backbone network, **needs to be modified according to the selected model**, including `b`, `l`, `h`.
- `model/backbone/path_type`ÔºöThe path type of the model, **needs to be modified according to the selected model**.
- `default_hooks-CheckpointHook`ÔºöConfiguration of the checkpoint saving during the model training process, generally no need to modify.
- `num_classes`ÔºöThe number of categories in the dataset, **needs to be modified according to the number of categories in the dataset**.
- `dataset_type`ÔºöThe type of the dataset, **needs to be modified according to the type of the dataset**.
- `resume`: Whether to resume training, generally no need to modify.
- `load_from`ÔºöThe path of the pre-trained checkpoint of the model, generally no need to modify.
- `data_preprocessor/mean/std`ÔºöThe mean and standard deviation of data preprocessing, **needs to be modified according to the mean and standard deviation of the dataset**, generally no need to modify, refer to [Python script](tools/rsmamba/get_dataset_img_meanstd.py).

Some parameters come from the inheritance value of `_base_`, you can find them in the [basic configuration files](configs/rsmamba/_base_/) folder.

#### Single Card Training

```shell
python tools/train.py configs/rsmamba/name_to_config.py  # name_to_config.py is the configuration file you want to use
```

#### Multi-card Training

```shell
sh ./tools/dist_train.sh configs/rsmamba/name_to_config.py ${GPU_NUM}  # name_to_config.py is the configuration file you want to use, GPU_NUM is the number of GPUs used
```

### Other Image Classification Models

## FAQ

<details open>

We have listed some common problems and their corresponding solutions here. If you find that some problems are missing, please feel free to submit a PR to enrich this list. If you cannot get help here, please use [issue](https://github.com/KyanChen/RSMamba/issues) to seek help. Please fill in all the required information in the template, which will help us locate the problem more quickly.

### 1. Do I need to install MMPretrain?

We recommend that you do not install MMPretrain, as we have made some modifications to the code of MMPretrain, and installing MMPretrain may cause the code to run incorrectly. If you encounter an error that the module has not been registered, please check:

- If MMPretrain is installed, uninstall it
- If `@MODELS.register_module()` is added in front of the class name, if not, add it
- If `from .xxx import xxx` is added in `__init__.py`, if not, add it
- If `custom_imports = dict(imports=['mmpretrain.rsmamba'], allow_failed_imports=False)` is added in the Config file, if not, add it


### 2. Solution to dist_train.sh: Bad substitution

If you encounter a `Bad substitution` error when running `dist_train.sh`, use `bash dist_train.sh` to run the script.


### 3. Installation of causal-conv1d and mamba-ssm failed

- If you encounter an error when installing causal-conv1d and mamba-ssm, check if your CUDA version matches the requirements of the installation package.
- If the problem persists, download the corresponding precompiled package, and then use `pip install xxx.whl` to install it. Refer to [causal-conv1d](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/causal-conv1d/releases) and [mamba-ssm](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/releases).
